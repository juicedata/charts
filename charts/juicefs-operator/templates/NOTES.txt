1. Wait for the operator to be ready using kubectl wait:

kubectl wait --for=condition=Available=true --timeout=120s deployment/juicefs-operator

2. Create the sample Cache Group Cluster

apiVersion: juicefs.io/v1
kind: CacheGroup
metadata:
  name: cachegroup-sample
spec:
  secretRef:
    name: juicefs-secret
  worker:
    template:
      nodeSelector:
        juicefs.io/cg-worker: "true"
      image: juicedata/mount:ee-5.1.1-1faf43b
      opts:
        - group-weight=100
      resources:
        requests:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 128Mi
        limits:
          cpu: 200m
          memory: 1Gi

{{ if .Release.IsUpgrade -}}
If you are upgrading from a version of the chart that uses older Custom Resource Definitions (CRD) it is necessary to manually upgrade the CRDs as this is not managed by Helm.
To update to the latest version of the CRDs:

  $ kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/juicedata/juicefs-operator/refs/tags/v{{ .Chart.AppVersion }}/dist/crd.yaml

{{- end -}}
